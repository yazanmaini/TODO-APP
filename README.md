# TODO-APP
This web-app creates a TODO list using Javascript. In this TODO list, you can mark the activity completed or can delete it. When you click on completed icon, It takes the item to another unordered list below which will be seperated from the TODO using a horizontal line and will also blur it so that the user knows that those items are completed.
